This repository is the official content repository for the Gloabl FishTracking Service (GFTS), a Destination Earth Platform Use Case procured by ESA.

## The GFTS in a nutshell

The lack of accurate modelling of fish movement, migration strategies, and site fidelity is a major challenge for policy-makers when they need to formulate effective conservation policies.
By relying on the Pangeo infrastructure on the DestinatE Platform, the Use Case aims to predict the sea bass behavior and develop a Decision Support Tool (DST) for ‚Äúwhat-if‚Äù scenario planning.
As a result, the Use Case will help to obtain accurate insights into fish populations by introducing the Global Fish Tracking System (GFTS) and a Decision Support Tool into the DestinE Platform.

## Build, Installation, and Execution Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have Python 3.11 installed.

### Supported Environments

This project is compatible with macOS and Linux distributions with Python 3.11 installed.

### Build Instructions

To build this project, ensure you have Python 3 and all the necessary Python packages (see environmemt.yml) installed on your system.

#### Clone the github repository

To get a local copy of the GFTS repository, you can clone it on your local computer and/or server:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/destination-earth/DestinE_ESA_GFTS.git
```

### Installation Instructions [local installation]

The sections below explain how to install and run DestinE_ESA_GFTS jupyter notebooks locally from source. We assume you have already cloned the github repository.

Jupyter notebooks to showcase GFTS are in the `docs` folder and can be run after installing Python and the required packages listed in the [.binder/environment.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/annefou/DestinE_ESA_GFTS/main/.binder/environment.yml) file.

#### Installation with Conda

To install Python, we recommend to install [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html) or [miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/) and then create a new conda environment using [.binder/environment.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/annefou/DestinE_ESA_GFTS/main/.binder/environment.yml):

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Do not forget to switch to the `gfts` conda environment prior to executing any Jupyter notebooks or programs from the GFTS repository.

```bash
conda activate gfts
```

To deactivate the `gfts` environment:

```bash
conda deactivate
```

#### Installation with pip

We assume you have installed Python 3.11 on your system. To install the necessary Python package with `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Execution Instructions

The section below explains how to start JupyerLab and run the Jupyter notebooks.

Once all the required packages are installed, you can start JupyterLab and execute the jupyter notebooks from the `docs` folder:

```bash
jupyter lab
```

### Installation instructions [using containers]

Before building the GFTS docker image, you would need to install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

#### Build docker container

Make sure you change directory to `gfts-track-reconstruction/jupyterhub/images/user` before executing the command below:

```bash
docker build -t gfts:latest .
```

#### Run GFTS from docker

```bash
docker run -p 7777:8888 -i -t gfts:latest jupyter lab --ip=0.0.0.0 --no-browser
```

Open your web browser and enter the following command:

```bash
http://127.0.0.1:7777/lab
```

Then you need to enter your token: it can be found at the bottom of the printout you got after running the docker run command given above.

### Installation instruction [Deploy GFTS Hub on the cloud]

Instructions on how to build and deploy GFTS hub are described in [./gfts-track-reconstruction/jupyterhub/README.md](https://github.com/destination-earth/DestinE_ESA_GFTS/blob/main/gfts-track-reconstruction/jupyterhub/README.md).

The current Jupyterhub deployment is done on OVH cloud operator.
